# Rewriting Golang Standard Packages

This repository is a personal project where I aim to rewrite Golang's standard packages from scratch. The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of Golang and serve as a reference for others who are learning the language.

## About the Project

Rewriting standard packages provides a hands-on approach to learning how Golang works under the hood. Each package will be carefully studied, reimplemented, and tested to ensure it replicates the functionality of the original.

## Packages

- [**strings**](https://github.com/cauelz/golang-standard-packages-roadmap/blob/master/src/strings/strings.go)
- [**unicode**](https://github.com/cauelz/golang-standard-packages-roadmap/tree/master/src/unicode)

## Goals

- Gain a deeper understanding of Golang's standard library.
- Improve coding skills and best practices in Golang.
- Provide a reference for other Golang learners.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository, run the tests, and compare the implementations with the original Golang packages. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
